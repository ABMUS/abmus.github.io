<p>
The central goal of ABMUS is to bring together the community of researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and agent systems to understand and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems. Through the exchange of ideas and state-of-the-art within this area, we will pool together current thinking to discuss both the main avenues of fruitful research and the methodological challenges that we face in building robust and realistic models of urban systems.
</p>

<p>
An overarching theme for the workshop in 2017 was <i>data for agent-based urban models</i>, which is fundamental for all modelling activities and case studies and can be used to generate synthetic populations, calibrate geospatial and behavioural models and validate emerging phenomena. We discussed data collection and data management, and shared insights in valuable data sets that could perhaps be translated and re-used between sectors and countries. Foundation data sets or shared data structures could enable interoperability of agent-based models, with individual models
representing a particular sector. Together, these could create insights for complex city systems.
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers<a name="cfp"></a></h2>

<p>
Researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and agent systems to understand, explore, and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems are invited to submit papers to ABMUS2017. The overarching theme for the workshop is data for agent-based models. Data is essential for building, calibrating, and validating agent-based city and urban infrastructure models. But which approaches are optimal for what purposes? We invite presentations that describe data collection and data management approaches in agent-based models, as well as the use of data sets and methodologies that can be translated and re-used between researchers, sectors and countries.
</p>

<p>
Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Large scale urban simulation applications</li>
<li>Agent-based modelling of urban transport, land-use, housing, energy, health, etc.</li>
<li>Spatially explicit micro-simulation modelling</li>
<li>Simulation of household behaviour and technology adoption</li>
<li>Localized population synthesis</li>
<li>Multi-scale urban systems (temporal and spatial)</li>
<li>Social simulation of demographic transitions</li>
<li>Use of mobile technology to validate activity patterns</li>
<li>Techniques for integrating independently developed components</li>
<li>Agent-based platforms for urban simulation</li>
<li>Data structures for simulating urban environments</li>
<li>(Multi-)agent systems for decision support in e.g. transport, energy use and air quality</li>
<li>Connection of simulation models to social and geographical theory</li>
<li>Development of 'master' city datasets for model validation</li>
</ul>

<p>
At the workshop each presenter will be given 10 minutes to introduce their paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which presenters will share their views on the data for agent-based models theme. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of group discussion in which presenters will act as panel members.

<h2>Programme<a name="programme"></a></h2>

<p>
The agenda for the ABMUS2017 workshop, held on the 8th of May 2017, is available <a href="ABMUS2017-workshop-schedule.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

</p>
<strong>Workshop format</strong>
<p>
The workshop will take place over one full day, with paper presentations grouped by theme, such as "transport", "energy", "health", "demographics" or other city sectors, and finally a session on "system interoperability and a holistic view of cities as complex systems" to bring the other themes together and enable participants to build links and discuss collaboration. Following the successful format of the ABMUS2016 workshop, each presenter will be given a short time slot (max 10 minutes) to introduce the paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which they present their views on the data theme (or other shared themes identified during the review process) following a predefined format of issues. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of overall discussion in which the presenters act as panel members.
