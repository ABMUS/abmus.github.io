<h2>About</h2>


<p>
The ABMUS2018 workshop on Agent-based modelling of urban systems will held on the 15th of July 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. The workshop is part of the Federated AI Meeting (FAIM2018), which includes the <a href="http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/" target="_blank">AAMAS2018</a> conference and <a href="https://www.ijcai-18.org/" target="_blank">IJCAI-ECAI</a> (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence). It is the follow-up of <a href="http://www.modelling-urban-systems.com/abmus2016" target="_blank">ABMUS2016</a> held in Singapore during <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/aamas2016" target="_blank">AAMAS2016</a> on the 10th of May 2016 and <a href="http://www.modelling-urban-systems.com/abmus2017" target="_blank">ABMUS2017</a> held in Sao Paulo during <a href="http://www.aamas2017.org" target="_blank">AAMAS2017</a> on the 8th of May 2017.
</p>

<p>
The central goal of this workshop is to bring together the community of researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and multi-agent systems to understand and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems.  Through the exchange of ideas and state-of-the-art within this area, we will pool together current thinking to discuss avenues of fruitful research and methodological challenges we face in building robust, realistic, and trusted models of urban systems.
</p>

<p>
Drawing from a recognised ongoing challenge associated with communication of agent-based and multi-agent systems to applied audiences in industry and government, an overarching theme for the workshop this year will be <i>balancing insight and numbers</i>, asking participants to emphasise how modelled systems have balanced the provision of mechanistic insight into complex challenges facing urban systems with the practical challenges of producing results for real-world decision support. We will discuss challenges associated with model development, deployment and communication, as well as developments in interfaces and stakeholder engagement.
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers<a name="cfp"></a></h2>

<p>
Agent-based modelling has proven itself to be a useful technique for understanding and predicting changes and impact of urban form and policy on urban systems. However, recognised challenges remain in designing, developing and implementing trusted models that can be used by industry and governments to enhance decision-making. This workshop invites submissions from researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and agent systems to understand, explore, and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems.
</p>

<p>
In particular, we invite presentations that describe efforts and challenges in design, development and deployment of urban system models that have balanced the provision of mechanistic insight into complex challenges facing urban systems vs practical challenges of producing 'numbers' for real-world decision support for industry and government.
</p>

<p>
Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Large scale urban simulation applications</li>
<li>Spatially explicit micro-simulation modelling</li>
<li>Agent-based modelling of urban transport, land-use, housing, energy, health, etc.</li>
<li>Simulation of household behaviour and technology adoption</li>
<li>Localized population synthesis</li>
<li>Multi-scale urban systems (temporal and spatial)</li>
<li>Social simulation of demographic transitions</li>
<li>Model development and co-development processes and protocols</li>
<li>Data structures for simulating urban environments</li>
<li>(Multi-)agent systems to provide decision support in e.g. transport, energy and air quality</li>
<li>Connection of simulation models to social and geographical theory</li>
<li>Government and industry engagement in model development and uptake</li>
<li>Processes of model co-development to enhance decision-making in urban systems</li>
<li>Development in model interfaces and engagement that enhance model uptake</li>

</ul>

<p>
If accepted, each presenter will be given a short time slot (max 10 minutes) to introduce their paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which presenters will share their views on the balancing insight and numbers theme. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of group discussion in which presenters will act as panel members.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be submitted as an extended abstract (2-4 pages) through the workshop website. Your abstract should include a Title as well as all authors and affiliations. It should articulate the objectives of the paper and provide a brief but thorough description of the research related to the theme of the workshop and the expected gain by those attending the presentation. Accepted authors will be invited to submit a full paper after the workshop to be included in the post-workshop proceedings.
</p>
