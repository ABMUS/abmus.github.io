<h2>About</h2>

<p>
The ABMUS2019 workshop on Agent-based modelling of urban systems was held on the 14th of May 2019 in Montreal, Canada. The workshop was part of the <a href="http://aamas2019.encs.concordia.ca/" target="_blank">AAMAS2019 conference</a> which took place between 13th-17th of May. Previously, <a href="http://abmus2016.modelling-urban-systems.com" target="_blank">ABMUS2016</a> was held in Singapore during <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/aamas2016" target="_blank">AAMAS2016</a> on the 10th of May 2016, <a href="http://abmus2017.modelling-urban-systems.com/" target="_blank">ABMUS2017</a> was held in Sao Paulo during <a href="http://www.aamas2017.org" target="_blank">AAMAS2017</a> on the 8th of May 2017 and last year  <a href="http://abmus2018.modelling-urban-systems.com/" target="_blank">ABMUS2018</a> was held in Stockholm during the Federated AI Meeting (FAIM2018) which included the <a href="http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/" target="_blank">AAMAS2018</a> conference and <a href="https://www.ijcai-18.org/" target="_blank">IJCAI-ECAI</a> (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence).
</p>

<p>
The central goal of this workshop is to bring together the community of researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and multi-agent systems to understand and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems.  Through the exchange of ideas and state-of-the-art within this area, we will pool together current thinking to discuss avenues of fruitful research and methodological challenges we face in building robust, realistic, and trusted models of urban systems.
</p>

<p>
ABMUS offers a workshop where urban and geo-spatial models appear in one concentrated session. The workshop showcases state-of-the-art applications of agent technology, showing other AAMAS participants this exciting application domain, while also offering a setting for focused discussion around common themes associated with urban system modelling and community building among researchers. The overarching theme for 2019 is <i>humans and devices</i>, exploring how simulation models of cities can be used by people for decision-support and interactive exploration of scenarios, and how data from sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) devices can be incorporated in urban models.
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers<a name="cfp"></a></h2>

<p>
Agent-based modelling has proven itself to be a useful technique for understanding and predicting changes and impact of urban form and policy on urban systems. However, recognised challenges remain in designing, developing and implementing trusted models that can be used by industry and governments to enhance decision-making, and that can incorporate real (and real-time) data sets in a meaninful way. This workshop invites submissions from researchers and practitioners who develop and use agent-based models and agent systems to understand, explore, and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems.
</p>

<p>
In particular, we invite presentations that fall under the <i>humans and devices</i> theme and describe how modelled systems can be used interactively by users for policy insight and how data from IoT devices and sensors can be applied directly in urban simulation models. We will discuss challenges associated with model development, data interoperability, deployment and communication, as well as developments in interfaces and user engagement.
</p>

<p>
Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Large scale urban simulation applications</li>
<li>Spatially explicit micro-simulation modelling</li>
<li>Agent-based modelling of urban transport, land-use, housing, energy, health, etc.</li>
<li>Simulation of household behaviour and technology adoption</li>
<li>Localized population synthesis</li>
<li>Multi-scale urban systems (temporal and spatial)</li>
<li>Social simulation of demographic transitions</li>
<li>Model development and co-development processes and protocols</li>
<li>Data structures for simulating urban environments</li>
<li>(Multi-)agent systems to provide decision support in e.g. transport, energy and air quality</li>
<li>Connection of simulation models to social and geographical theory</li>
<li>Government and industry engagement in model development and uptake</li>
<li>Processes of model co-development to enhance decision-making in urban systems</li>
<li>Development in model interfaces and engagement that enhance model uptake</li>
<li>Internet of Things (IoT), open data and data interoperability for modelling</li>

</ul>

<p>
If accepted, each presenter will be given a short time slot (max 10 minutes) to introduce their paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which presenters will share their views on the workshop theme. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of group discussion in which presenters will act as panel members.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be submitted as an extended abstract (2-4 pages) through the workshop website. Your abstract should include a Title as well as all authors and affiliations. It should articulate the objectives of the paper and provide a brief but thorough description of the research related to the theme of the workshop and the expected gain by those attending the presentation. Accepted authors will be invited to submit a full paper after the workshop to be included in the post-workshop proceedings.
