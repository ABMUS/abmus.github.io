<h2>About ABMUS</h2>

<p>
    ABMUS is a workshop where urban and geo-spatial models get together in a focused session, during the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS).
    The ABMUS2022 workshop on Agent-Based Modelling of Urban Systems will be held online on 9 or 10 May 2022 as part of the <a href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">AAMAS2022 conference</a>.
    In 2022 the conference was due to take place in Auckland, New Zealand, but due to the pandemic the conference and the AMBUS workshop will be held virtually.
</p>

<p>
    The central goal of this workshop is to bring together the community of researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and multi-agent systems to understand and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems. Through the exchange of ideas and state-of-the-art within this area, we will pool together current thinking to discuss avenues of fruitful research and methodological challenges we face in building robust, realistic, and trusted models of urban systems. Drawing from recognised challenges faced by the modeling community through the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public policy crises, the overarching theme for the workshop this year will be ‘Trust, Transparency and Translation’. Participants will be asked to describe how their models are creating a bridge between the synthetic and real worlds, and making their way into real-world policy and decision-making. This year, we invite presentations that describe how researchers construct their models, demonstrate results, work with policy and decision-makers, and how these processes either facilitate or hinder the process of urban systems model building from the modellers perspective. We will discuss challenges associated with model development, data interoperability, consistent representation of space and time, as well as developments in interfaces and stakeholder engagement.

<h2>ABMUS2022: 'Trust, Transparency and Translation'<a name="cfp"></a></h2>

<p>
    We invite submissions from researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and agent systems to understand, explore,
	and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems. The overarching theme for 2022 is Trust, Transparency and Translation.
     Participants will be asked to describe how their models are creating a bridge between the synthetic and real worlds, and making their
	way into real-world policy and decision-making. This year, we invite presentations that describe how researchers construct
	their models, demonstrate results, work with policy and decision-makers, and how these processes either facilitate or hinder
	the process of urban systems model building from the modellers perspective. We will discuss challenges associated with model
	development, data interoperability, consistent representation of space and time, as well as developments in interfaces and stakeholder engagement.

    </ul>

<p>
    The workshop recognises the importance of allowing delegates the opportunity to discuss the topics and so mixes short paper presentations with longer discussions and questions. If accepted, each presenter will be given a short time slot (max 10 minutes) to introduce their paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which presenters will share their views on the multi-level modelling theme. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of discussion in which presenters will act as panel members in direct discussion with the ABMUS audience. In 20201 the AAMAS conference, and the AMBUS workshop, will be held virtually.
</p>

<p>
    Papers should be submitted as an extended abstract (2-4 pages) through Easy Chair (details <a href="#submission">below</a>).

<h2>Submission and important dates<a name="submission"></a></h2>

<p>
<strong>How to submit a paper</strong>
</p>

<p>
Participants are invited to submit an extended abstract (2-4 pages, plus references) describing their work on one or more of the topics relevant to the workshop. Your abstract should include a title as well as all authors and affiliations. It should articulate the objectives of the paper and provide a brief but thorough description of the research related to the theme of the workshop and the expected gain by those attending the presentation. Accepted authors will be invited to submit a full paper after the workshop to be included in the post-workshop proceedings. All submissions to the workshop will be reviewed by the organising committee and program committee, with at least two independent reviews per paper.
</p>

<p>
Authors are requested to prepare their papers by following the <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" target="_blank">LNCS Springer instructions</a>, preferably using the LaTeX template provided but an MS Word template is also available.
